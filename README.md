# 🚀 FusionConnect

**FusionConnect** is a DeFi integration demo that simulates intent-based token swaps using a smart contract connected to a frontend. Inspired by protocols like 1inch Fusion and built for ETHGlobal hackathons, this project shows how a developer can prototype on-chain trading logic with live UI interaction.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 🎯 Why This Project?

ETHGlobal hackathons look for:
- Developers who can finish & ship
- Projects that explore real DeFi ideas
- MVPs that could be extended into full products

**FusionConnect** fits that criteria by showing a functioning DeFi simulation with an on-chain contract and wallet UX.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Integrate real token addresses on Sepolia
- Add token approval flow
- Replace mock router with actual 1inch Fusion Router
- Add cross-chain messaging with LayerZero / Chainlink CCIP
- Enable slippage controls, swap history
